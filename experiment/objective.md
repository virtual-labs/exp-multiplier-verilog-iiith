1. To demonstrate the practical implementation of Multipliers using the Verilog hardware description language.

2. To enable learners to simulate and analyze the behavior of Multipliers using software tools.

3. To foster a deeper understanding of how Multipliers can be used to build more complex sequential circuits.
